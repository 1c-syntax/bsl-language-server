For example: the parameter can be the maximum string length for diagnostics for long strings or a list of numeric constants that are not magic numbers. Diagnostic parameter implementation \u00b6 To implement the diagnostic parameter, you need to make changes to the diagnostic files. Diagnostic class change \u00b6 Add a constant field to the diagnostic class, in which the default value of the parameter will be saved. For example private static final String DEFAULT_COMMENTS_ANNOTATION = \"//@\"; . It is necessary to add a private field in which the parameter value will be stored. The field needs to be annotated @DiagnosticParameter In the annotation, you must specify the type of the parameter and the default value (the value is always a string type). For example @DiagnosticParameter ( type = String . class , defaultValue = \"\" + DEFAULT_COMMENTS_ANNOTATION ) private String commentsAnnotation = DEFAULT_COMMENTS_ANNOTATION ; If the parameter is primitive or of type String and it is set by a simple setter, then that's it. If the parameter is \"hard\", for example, a pattern string for a regular expression that must be evaluated before setting, then you need to implement a method for setting parameter values configure . For example, there are two parameters: commentAsCode - recognize comments as code, type boolean excludeMethods - \u043cmethods that do not need to be checked, type ArrayList Then the method of setting the parameter values will look: @Override public void configure ( Map < String , Object > configuration ) { // to set \"simple properties\" including \"commentAsCode\" super . configure ( configuration ); // setting the \"hard\" property \"excludeMethods\" String excludeMethodsString = ( String ) configuration . getOrDefault ( \"excludeMethods\" , EXCLUDE_METHODS_DEFAULT ); this . excludeMethods = new ArrayList <> ( Arrays . asList ( excludeMethodsString . split ( \",\" ))); } Test change \u00b6 It is necessary to add a test to change the diagnostic settings. The test is added to the diagnostic test class (a separate method for each combination of diagnostic setting options) . At the beginning of the test, you need to set the value of the diagnostic parameter, the subsequent steps are similar to the general rules for writing tests. To set a diagnostic parameter from a test, you need to get the default diagnostic configuration using the method getDefaultConfiguration() from the metadata of the current diagnostic diagnosticInstance.getInfo() . The next step is to change the parameter value by adding to the configuration collection, and then reconfigure using the method configure . Example // get current configuration Map < String , Object > configuration = diagnosticInstance . getInfo (). getDefaultConfiguration (); // setting the new value configuration . put ( \"commentsAnnotation\" , \"//(\u0441)\" ); // reconfiguring diagnosticInstance . configure ( configuration ); Adding a Parameter Description \u00b6 For correct operation, it is necessary to add a parameter description for each language in the diagnostic resource files. Diagnostic resources are located in files resources/com/github/_1c_syntax/bsl/languageserver/diagnostics/<DIAGNOSTIC_KEY>_en.properties and resources/com/github/_1c_syntax/bsl/languageserver/diagnostics/<DIAGNOSTIC_KEY>_ru.properties . In each file, add a new line with the parameter name and description commentsAnnotation = Skip annotation comments starting with the specified substrings. A comma separated list.

Diagnostic contents (briefly) \u00b6 To implement diagnostics, you need to create several files Diagnostic implementation class Two resource files (for English and Russian) containing the name of the diagnostic and the error message BSL fixture file used for diagnostic testing Diagnostic test class Two files (for English and Russian) with diagnostic documentation A detailed description of the contents of the files and the rules of use can be found in article . Create Diagnostic \u00b6 Below is an example of creating diagnostics based on the already created one. Determining the purpose of diagnostic \u00b6 Before implementing a new diagnostic, you need to define its purpose - what error (or deficiency) you need to detect. As an example, we will write a diagnostic that checks for the presence of a semicolon ; at the end of each expression. The next step is to come up with a unique diagnostic key, under which it will be added to the general list of diagnostics. Let's take the name SemicolonPresence . Diagnostic implementation class \u00b6 In the directory src/main/java in the package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics , create the SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic.java diagnostic class file. In the file, create the class of the same name, inherited from the AbstractVisitorDiagnostic class. The result will be package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics ; public class SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic extends AbstractVisitorDiagnostic { } Each diagnostic must have a @DiagnosticMetadata , class annotation containing diagnostic metadata. Details on annotations in [article][DiagnosticStructure]. In the example, we implement diagnostics related to the quality of the code ( CODE_SMELL ), low priority ( MINOR ), which requires 1 minute to fix and related to the 1C standard. The resulting annotated class package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics ; @DiagnosticMetadata ( type = DiagnosticType . CODE_SMELL , severity = DiagnosticSeverity . MINOR , minutesToFix = 1 , tag = { DiagnosticTag . STANDARD } ) public class SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic extends AbstractVisitorDiagnostic { } Class resources \u00b6 In the directory src/main/resources in the package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics create 2 diagnostic resource files. In our example, these will be files SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic_ru.properties and SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic_en.properties . Save the name (parameter diagnosticName ) and message ( diagnosticMessage ) of the diagnostic in the created files. In our example, the contents of the files will be like this File SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic_ru.properties diagnosticMessage = Missing semicolon at end of expression diagnosticName = Expression must end with \";\" File SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic_en.properties diagnosticMessage = Missed semicolon at the end of statement diagnosticName = Statement should end with \";\" Test fixtures \u00b6 For testing purposes, let's add a file to the project containing examples of both erroneous and correct code. We will place the SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic.bsl file with fixtures in the src/test/resources resources directory in the diagnostics package. As data for testing, let's add the code to the file A = 0 ; If True Then A = 0 ; A = 0 // Diagnostics should work here EndIf // and here Attention! It is necessary to mark with comments the places where the diagnostics should work. Test writing \u00b6 In the directory src/test/java in the package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics create a file SemicolonPresenceDiagnosticTest.java for the test diagnostic class. In the file, create a class of the same name inherited from the AbstractDiagnosticTest class for the created diagnostic class. As a result, we get package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics ; class SemicolonPresenceDiagnosticTest extends AbstractDiagnosticTest < SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic > { SemicolonPresenceDiagnosticTest () { super ( SemicolonPresenceDiagnostic . class ); } } Simplified basic test consists of the steps getting a list of diagnostics checking the number of items found checking the location of detected items Without going into detail, remember that To get diagnostics for a fixture, use the getDiagnostics() method implemented in the abstract class AbstractDiagnosticTest . It returns a list of encountered errors of the current type. To check the number of errors, use the hasSize , assertion, the parameter of which will be the number of expected elements. To check for each error, it is necessary to compare the error range with the expected range.

Need to use visitor visitStatement . Each selected node of the AST-tree must contain an ending \"semicolon\" represented by node SEMICOLON . Thus, the check will be to find the SEMICOLON token in each statement node. If the token is not found, then an error must be added. After implementation of the check, the file will take the form package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics ; @DiagnosticMetadata ( type = DiagnosticType . CODE_SMELL , severity = DiagnosticSeverity . MINOR , minutesToFix = 1 , tag = { DiagnosticTag .

Details in help gradlew -q help --task newDiagnostic . Diagnostics implementation class \u00b6 Diagnostics is implemented by adding a java class to the com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics package in the src/main/java directory. In the body of the file, you need to specify the package to which the class and the import block are added (when using ide, the import list is updated automatically) . It is necessary to ensure that only is imported that is necessary for implementation, everything unused should be removed (if settings are correct, then ide will do everything automatically) . Each diagnostic must have a @DiagnosticMetadata , class annotation containing diagnostic metadata. The actual content can always be obtained by examining the file . At the time of this writing, the following properties are available: The type of diagnostics is type and its importance is severity , for each diagnostics it is necessary to define them. In order to choose the correct type and importance of diagnostics, you can refer to article . Time to fix issue minutesToFix (default 0). This value is used when calculating the total technical debt of the project in labor costs to correct all comments (the sum of time to correct for all detected comments). It is worth indicating the time, as realistic as possible, that the developer should spend on fixing. A set of diagnostics tags tag that indicate the group to which it belongs. Read more about tags in the article . Applicability limit scope (by default ALL , i.e. no limit). BSL LS supports multiple languages (oscript and bsl) and diagnostics can be applied to one specific language or to all at once. Default diagnostic active activatedByDefault (default True ). When developing experimental, controversial, or not applicable in most projects, it is worth turning off diagnostics by default, the activation will be performed by the end user of the solution. Compatibility mode compatibilityMode , by which diagnostics are filtered when using metadata. The default is UNDEFINED . The last two can be omitted. Annotation example @DiagnosticMetadata ( type = DiagnosticType . CODE_SMELL , severity = DiagnosticSeverity . MINOR , minutesToFix = 1 , activatedByDefault = false , // Deactivated by default scope = DiagnosticScope . BSL , // Applicable only for BSL compatibilityMode = DiagnosticCompatibilityMode . COMPATIBILITY_MODE_8_3_3 , // 8.3.3 compatibility mode tags = { DiagnosticTag . STANDARD // This is a diagnosis for violation of the 1C standard } ) Class should implement the interface BSLDiagnostic . If diagnostic bases on AST, that class should extends at one of classes, that implement BSLDiagnostic below: for simple diagnostics (module context checking) it is worth using inheritance AbstractVisitor with the implementation of a single check method if you need to analyze a visit to a node / sequence of nodes, use the listener strategy, you need to inherit the class from AbstractListenerDiagnostic in other cases, you need to use the strategy visitor and AbstractVisitorDiagnostic for diagnostics of 1C code AbstractSDBLVisitorDiagnostic for diagnostics of 1C query Examples public class TemplateDiagnostic implements BSLDiagnostic public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractDiagnostic public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractVisitorDiagnostic public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractListenerDiagnostic public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractSDBLVisitorDiagnostic public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractSDBLListenerDiagnostic Diagnostic may provide so-called quick fixes . In order to provide quick fixes the diagnostic class must implement QuickFixProvider interface. See this article on adding a quick fix to diagnostic. Examples public class TemplateDiagnostic implements BSLDiagnostic , QuickFixProvider public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractDiagnostic implements QuickFixProvider public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractVisitorDiagnostic implements QuickFixProvider public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractListenerDiagnostic implements QuickFixProvider public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractSDBLVisitorDiagnostic implements QuickFixProvider public class TemplateDiagnostic extends AbstractSDBLListenerDiagnostic implements QuickFixProvider After the declaration of the class, a block with their parameters is located for parameterizable diagnostics. For details on the diagnostic parameters, see the article . Below are the differences in the implementation of diagnostic classes. Diagnostics class, implements BSLDiagnostic interface \u00b6 In the class, you need to define a private field diagnosticStorage of type DiagnosticStorage to store detected diagnostics, and a private property info of type DiagnosticInfo , for access to diagnostic data. private DiagnosticStorage diagnosticStorage = new DiagnosticStorage ( this ); private final DiagnosticInfo info ; In the class, you need to implement: method getDiagnostics accepting the context of the file being analyzed and returning a list of detected diagnostics List<Diagnostic> getter getInfo setter setInfo Method structure getDiagnostics @Override public List < Diagnostic > getDiagnostics ( DocumentContext documentContext ) { // Clearing diagnostics storage diagnosticStorage . clearDiagnostics (); documentContext . getComments () // Getting the collection of tokens, here comments . parallelStream () . filter (( Token t ) -> // Search for \"necessary\" - those that the diagnostics is aimed at detecting ! goodCommentPattern . matcher ( t . getText ()). matches ()) . sequential () . forEach (( Token t ) -> // Adding errors, here for each token a separate error diagnosticStorage . addDiagnostic ( t )); // Return of found return diagnosticStorage . getDiagnostics (); } Diagnostics class, inherits from AbstractDiagnostic \u00b6 For simple diagnostics, you should inherit your class from the AbstractDiagnostic class. In the diagnostic class, you need to implement the check method. The method should analyze the context of the document and, if noted, add diagnostics to diagnosticStorage . Example: @Override protected void check () { documentContext . getTokensFromDefaultChannel () . parallelStream () . filter (( Token t ) -> t . getType () == BSLParser . IDENTIFIER && t . getText (). toUpperCase ( Locale . ENGLISH ). contains ( \"\u0401\" )) . forEach ( token -> diagnosticStorage . addDiagnostic ( token )); } Diagnostics class, inherits from AbstractVisitorDiagnostic \u00b6 In the diagnostic class, it is necessary to implement the methods of all necessary AST visitors , in accordance with the language grammar described in the BSLParser project. A complete list of existing visitor methods can be found in the BSLParserBaseVisitor class. Please note: for simplicity, generalized visitors have been created, for example, instead of two visitFunction for a function and visitProcedure for a procedure, you can use visitSub . As a parameter, an AST node of the corresponding type is passed to each method of the visitor. In the body of the method, it is necessary to analyze the node and / or its child nodes and decide if there is an error. When a problem is found, it must be added to diagnosticStorage (the field is already defined in the abstract class) . An error note can be attached to the passed node or to its child or parent nodes, to the desired block of code. Method structure @Override public ParseTree visitModuleVar ( BSLParser . ModuleVarContext ctx ) { // Visitor for module variables if ( Trees . findAllRuleNodes ( ctx , BSLParser . RULE_compilerDirective ). size () > 1 ) { // Finding child nodes diagnosticStorage . addDiagnostic ( ctx ); // Adding a error to the entire site } return ctx ; } If the diagnostics does not provide analysis of nested nodes, then it must return the passed input node, otherwise it is necessary to call the super-method of the same name. This rule will save application resources without making a meaningless call. Examples: Diagnostics for a method or file must immediately return a value, because nested methods/files do not exist Diagnostics for a condition or region block must call the super-method , as they exist and are used (e.g. return super.visitSub(ctx) for methods) Diagnostics class, inherits from AbstractSDBLVisitorDiagnostic \u00b6 The diagnostic class implements the necessary AST visitors , according to the grammar of the query language (see BSLParser ). The complete list of visitor methods is in the SDBLParserBaseVisitor class. The rest of the rules are identical to AbstractVisitorDiagnostic . Diagnostics class, inherits from AbstractListenerDiagnostic (Work in Progress) \u00b6 Diagnostics test class \u00b6 The tests use the JUnit5 framework and the AssertJ assertion library providing a fluent interface \"expectations\", like the familiar asserts library for OneScript . A test is a java class added to the com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics package in the src/test/java directory. In the file, you need to specify the package in which the class and the import block (similar to the diagnostic implementation class) are added, then you need to create a class of the same name to the file, inherited from the AbstractDiagnosticTest class for the created diagnostic class. Test class example package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics ; import org.eclipse.lsp4j.Diagnostic ; import com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.utils.Ranges ; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test ; import java.util.List ; import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat ; class TemplateDiagnosticTest extends AbstractDiagnosticTest < TemplateDiagnostic > { TemplateDiagnosticTest () { super ( TemplateDiagnostic . class ); } } To add a new test to the created class, you need to add a method with the @Test annotation. The test class must contain methods for testing. diagnostic test itself test of configuration method for parameterized diagnostics test \"quick fixes\" if available Diagnostics test \u00b6 Simplified, the diagnostic test contains the steps getting a list of diagnostics checking the number of items found checking the location of detected items The first step is to get the list of notes by calling the getDiagnostics() method (implemented in the AbstractDiagnosticTest class) . Calling this method will parse the diagnostics resource file and return a list of remarks in it. The next step is to use the hasSize() statement to make sure that the number of diagnostics is fixed as much as allowed in the fixtures. After that, you need to make sure that the diagnostics are detected correctly. To do this, you need to compare the diagnostic area obtained by the getRange() method with the expected area (you should use the RangeHelper class to simplify the formation of control values) . If the text of the error is templated, then it is necessary to check it in the test by getting the text of the error message using the getMessage() method of diagnostics. Test method example @Test void test () { List < Diagnostic > diagnostics = getDiagnostics (); // getting a list of diagnostics assertThat ( diagnostics ). hasSize ( 2 ); // checking the number of errors found // verification of special cases assertThat ( diagnostics ) . anyMatch ( diagnostic -> diagnostic . getRange (). equals ( Ranges . create ( 27 , 4 , 27 , 29 ))) . anyMatch ( diagnostic -> diagnostic . getRange (). equals ( Ranges . create ( 40 , 4 , 40 , 29 ))); } To reduce the amount of test code, you can use the util.Assertions.assertThat helper, then the example above will look like this: @Test void test () { List < Diagnostic > diagnostics = getDiagnostics (); // getting a list of diagnostics assertThat ( diagnostics ). hasSize ( 2 ); // checking the number of errors found // verification of special cases assertThat ( diagnostics , true ) . hasRange ( 27 , 4 , 27 , 29 ) . hasRange ( 40 , 4 , 40 , 29 ); } Test of configuration method for parameterized diagnostics \u00b6 Tests for the configuration method should cover all possible settings and their combinations. The test has almost the same structure as the diagnostic test. Before setting new values \u200b\u200bfor diagnostic parameters, you must get the default diagnostic settings using the getDefaultDiagnosticConfiguration() method using the information of the current diagnostic object diagnosticInstance.getInfo() . The result is a map in which the put method needs to change the values \u200b\u200bof the required parameters. To apply the changed settings, you need to call the configure() method of the current diagnostic object diagnosticInstance . Test method example @Test void testConfigure () { // getting default diagnostic settings Map < String , Object > configuration = diagnosticInstance . getInfo (). getDefaultDiagnosticConfiguration (); configuration . put ( \"templateParem\" , \"newValue\" ); // setting \"templateParem\" to \"newValue\" diagnosticInstance . configure ( configuration ); // applying settings List < Diagnostic > diagnostics = getDiagnostics (); // getting a list of diagnostics assertThat ( diagnostics ). hasSize ( 2 ); // checking the number of detected // special case check assertThat ( diagnostics , true ) . hasRange ( 27 , 4 , 27 , 29 ) . hasRange ( 40 , 4 , 40 , 29 ); } Quick fixes test (Work in progress) \u00b6 Diagnostics resources \u00b6 BSL LS supports two languages \u200b\u200bin diagnostics: Russian and English, so the diagnostics includes two resource files located in the src/main/resources directory in the com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.diagnostics package, one for each language. The file structure is the same: it is a text file in UTF-8 encoding, each line of which contains a \"Key=Value\" pair. Required parameters used when adding diagnostics using the diagnosticStorage.addDiagnostic method diagnosticMessage - diagnostic message. Value supports parameterization (see String.format ) diagnosticName - Diagnostic name, human-readable For quick fixes , the quickFixMessage parameter is used, which contains a description of the fix action. Diagnostics test resources \u00b6 The fixtures are the contents of the test resource file located in the src/test/resources directory in the diagnostics package. The file must contain the necessary code examples in 1C language (or oscript language) . It is necessary to add both erroneous and correct code, marking the places of errors with comments . It is best if the test cases are real , from practice, and not synthetic, invented for diagnostics . Diagnostics description \u00b6 The diagnostic description is created in the Markdown format in two versions - for Russian and English. The files are located in the docs/diagnostics directory for Russian, for English in docs/en/diagnostics . The file has the structure Header equal to the value of diagnosticName from the corresponding language's diagnostic resource file A block with a description of the diagnostics, indicating \"why it is so bad\" List of exceptions that diagnostics do not detect Examples of good and bad code The diagnostic algorithm, if it is not obvious If diagnostics is an implementation of the standard, then links to sources (for example, to ITS ).","title":"Diagnostics structure, files contents and purpose"},{"location":"contributing/DiagnosticStructure/#Diagnostics-structure-files-contents-and-purpose","text":"This article contains rules of diagnostics usage, creation and information about content templates.

In order to select the type and importance for the generated diagnostics, a detailed semantic description is given below. Severity \u00b6 The severity of diagnostics is set in the annotation @DiagnosticMetadata by the severity parameter and takes values \u200b\u200bof the DiagnosticSeverity type. Possible use cases (basic cases, unless otherwise stated): Blocker (BLOCKER) \u00b6 Errors that render the application inoperable. Used only for Errors and Vulnerabilities . Critical (CRITICAL) \u00b6 Incorrectly working key business logic, errors in the security system, problems leading to the temporary inoperability of the application or its components. Used only for Errors and Vulnerabilities . Important (MAJOR) \u00b6 Some of the core business logic doesn't work correctly, but there are workarounds; poor quality code that leads to poor performance, efficiency, floating bugs. Used only for Errors and Code Defects . Minor (MINOR) \u00b6 The business logic of the application is not violated, a floating error, low-quality, poorly supported code, bugs in rarely used functionality. Used only for Errors and Code Defects . Information (INFO) \u00b6 A trivial error not related to the business logic of the application; poorly reproducible problem; unobtrusive, having no effect on the overall quality of the product. Used only for Code Defects . Diagnostics type \u00b6 The severity of diagnostics is set in the annotation @DiagnosticMetadata by the type parameter and takes values \u200b\u200bof the DiagnosticType type. Vulnerability (VULNERABILITY) \u00b6 This type of diagnostics includes security errors. They should always be of severity Blocker if there is a known compromise, or Critical if there is none or the value of the leak is not high. Examples the compromise of personal data is a blocking vulnerability, since in addition to violation of the law, the information obtained can be used in various illegal actions. compromise of user reporting settings is a critical vulnerability, since can tell an attacker how to collect an important report, but does not give access to fulfill the request. Potential vulnerability (SECURITY_HOTSPOT) \u00b6 Diagnostics of this type highlight security-sensitive code fragments that require additional manual analysis. After the analysis, either the problem that needs to be corrected will be confirmed, or a decision is made that there is no problem. Diagnostics with this type should always have severity Critical . Examples Accessing the parameters of the user's computer operating system is not always a vulnerability. For example, the version of the OS architecture can be used to load the correct version of the library included with the application. User privilege escalation can occur in a planned manner while the operation is being performed in accordance with the business process, which is not a vulnerability. In other situations, disabling user access control is completely a vulnerability. Code defect (CODE_SMELL) \u00b6 Code defect does not lead to errors in the program, but complicates further development, the ability to adapt and extend functionality. Can be of any importance except Blocker and Critical . Needs fixing as important in the refactoring process. Error (ERROR) \u00b6 This category includes real errors during the user's work.

For example: BSL Language Server configuration file ( .bsl-language-server.json ) has a traceLog field. In it, you can specify the path to the file to display a detailed log of the interaction between the server and the client. When a configuration is changed, a \"server configuration changed\" event is generated, and all components can reread it and reconfigure themselves if this event is important to them. In this example, the log output component changes the path to the output file. The subsystem consists of three components: events; post events; event subscription. The main difference from Spring Events is the transfer of event publishing from application code to an isolated layer using aspect-oriented programming. A summary of Spring Events in the article https://www.baeldung.com/spring-events. Events \u00b6 All events are children of ApplicationEvent . The event class must be placed in the events subpackage of the package whose object can generate this event. For example, change event com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.configuration.LanguageServerConfiguration is located in the package com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.configuration.events and and has the name LanguageServerConfigurationChangedEvent . In the event class it is recommended: declare a constructor that takes the \"source\" of the event (the object on which the event fired) and calls the super constructor; override the getSource method, returning source cast to the source type. /** * Configuration change event. * <p> * Contains a link to the configuration as an event source. */ public class LanguageServerConfigurationChangedEvent extends ApplicationEvent { public LanguageServerConfigurationChangedEvent ( LanguageServerConfiguration configuration ) { super ( configuration ); } @Override public LanguageServerConfiguration getSource () { return ( LanguageServerConfiguration ) super . getSource (); } } Events publication \u00b6 The EventPublisherAspect aspect of the com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.aop package is used to publish events Brief information about aspect-oriented programming you can find in page https://www.baeldung.com/aspectj. To intercept events in an aspect, advice can be declared to intercept method calls and/or accesses to object properties. An event object must be created in the advice body and published via ApplicationEventPublisher . To form a pointcut expression, you need to use templates in the Pointcuts class of the com.github._1c_syntax.bsl.languageserver.aop package An example of intercepting the server configuration update event: @Aspect public class EventPublisherAspect { @AfterReturning ( \"Pointcuts.isLanguageServerConfiguration() && (Pointcuts.isResetCall() || Pointcuts.isUpdateCall())\" ) public void languageServerConfigurationUpdated ( JoinPoint joinPoint ) { var configuration = ( LanguageServerConfiguration ) joinPoint . getThis (); applicationEventPublisher . publishEvent ( new LanguageServerConfigurationChangedEvent ( configuration )); } } Events subscriptions \u00b6 To subscribe to an event, a component can implement the ApplicationListener interface or declare a public method annotated with @EventListener and taking a specific event class as a parameter.

Queries cannot use attributes from left-join or right-join tables without checking the values for NULL . Such a call can lead to errors if the join condition is not met and there are no matching records in the left or right table. As a result, as a result of executing the query, you may receive unexpected data and the system may behave in an incorrect way. It is important to remember that any comparison of the value NULL with any other expression is always false, even the comparison of NULL and NULL is always false. The following are examples of such incorrect comparisons. It is correct to compare with NULL - operator IS NULL or function ISNULL() . Left \\ right joins are often used, although the data allows an inner join without checking for NULL . Additional checks of field values can be performed in the 1C code, and not in the query text. This makes it difficult to read the code and refactor the code, because the context of the access to the field has to be considered in several places. It should be remembered that simple checks in a query are performed a little faster and easier than in interpreted 1C code. These problems are the most common mistakes made by 1C developers of all skill levels. Examples \u00b6 Example showing NULL comparison problems - joining 2 tables incorrectly and showing different comparison methods SELECT CASE WHEN LeftTable.Fld2 = 0 THEN \"Equals 0 - does not work\" WHEN LeftTable.Fld2 <> 0 THEN \"NOT Equals 0 - does not work\" WHEN LeftTable.Fld2 = NULL THEN \"Equals NULL - does not work\" WHEN LeftTable.Fld2 IS NULL THEN \"IS NULL - it works\" WHEN

Queries cannot use attributes from left-join or right-join tables without checking the values for NULL . Such a call can lead to errors if the join condition is not met and there are no matching records in the left or right table. As a result, as a result of executing the query, you may receive unexpected data and the system may behave in an incorrect way. It is important to remember that any comparison of the value NULL with any other expression is always false, even the comparison of NULL and NULL is always false. The following are examples of such incorrect comparisons. It is correct to compare with NULL - operator IS NULL or function ISNULL() . Left \\ right joins are often used, although the data allows an inner join without checking for NULL . Additional checks of field values can be performed in the 1C code, and not in the query text. This makes it difficult to read the code and refactor the code, because the context of the access to the field has to be considered in several places. It should be remembered that simple checks in a query are performed a little faster and easier than in interpreted 1C code. These problems are the most common mistakes made by 1C developers of all skill levels.","title":"Description"},{"location":"diagnostics/FieldsFromJoinsWithoutIsNull/#Examples","text":"Example showing

The rules for working with objects in temporary storage are often violated - storing data in it is not free. There are errors even in the documentation and numerous use cases. When placing data in temporary storage, you should choose one of two options: put data into temporary storage for the lifetime of the form using the unique identifier of the form and clean up this temporary storage after use. pre-initialize temporary storage and reuse it. Otherwise, if an action is repeated many times in a form, for example, if a product is selected many times, this leads to unnecessary consumption of RAM, because temporary stores are accumulating. Remember that when a value is retrieved from the temporary storage on the server, it will be retrieved by reference. This is a reference to the value that is stored in the cache.

FunctionParameters ( UUID ); LongOperations . ExecFunction ( Pframeters , BackgroundJobParameter ); If a long operation is performed by the user multiple times, then temporary storage accumulates, which causes an increase in memory consumption. To reduce the consumption of RAM, in most cases, it is recommended to clear the temporary storage immediately after receiving the result of the background job: Correct: \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0438 = \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0418\u0437\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442 . \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 ); \u0423\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0418\u0437\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442 . \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 ); // \u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f.

The rules for working with objects in temporary storage are often violated - storing data in it is not free. There are errors even in the documentation and numerous use cases. When placing data in temporary storage, you should choose one of two options: put data into temporary storage for the lifetime of the form using the unique identifier of the form and clean up this temporary storage after use. pre-initialize temporary storage and reuse it. Otherwise, if an action is repeated many times in a form, for example, if a product is selected many times, this leads to unnecessary consumption of RAM, because temporary stores are accumulating. Remember that when a value is retrieved from the temporary storage on the server, it will be retrieved by reference. This is a reference to the value that is stored in the cache. Within 20 minutes , from the moment it was put into the storage or from the moment of the last access, the value will be stored in the cache, and then written to disk and deleted from the cache. On the next call, the value is loaded from disk and put back into the cache.","title":"Diagnostics description"},{"location":"diagnostics/MissingTempStorageDeletion/#Examples","text":"1 - Example of correct code: &\u041d\u0430\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0435\u041f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 ( \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 , \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0412\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 , \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430 ) \u042d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0412\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 = \u041d\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442 ; \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 ; \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0418\u0437\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0412\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 ); \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u044b &\u041d\u0430\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0418\u0437\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0412\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 ) \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b = \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0418\u0437\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0412\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 ); \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442 . \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b . \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c ( \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b ); \u0423\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0418\u0437\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 ( \u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 ); // \u043e\u0447\u0438\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u044b 2 - Consider this recommendation when working with background jobs Incorrect: - Each time a background job is executed, its result is placed in temporary storage for the lifetime of the form: Parameters = LongOperations .

Instead of manually mark a comment as irrelevant every time, BSL LS provides functionality that allows you to hide or screen individual sections of code from triggering diagnostics.","title":"Escaping Code from Diagnostic"},{"location":"features/DiagnosticIgnorance/#Description","text":"To hide part of the code from the BSL LS analyzer, you must add a special comment to the code. The escaping comment is formed as follows: [Prefix][:DiagnosticKey]-[ActivationFlag] . Now in more detail. Prefix always is // BSLLS DiagnosticKey can be found in the list of diagnostics by description ActivationFlag string parameter if diagnostic is On or Off. Supported Russian ( \u0432\u043a\u043b and \u0432\u044b\u043a\u043b ) and English ( on and off ). To disable ALL diagnostics for part of the code, you must omit the diagnostic key.","title":"Description"},{"location":"features/DiagnosticIgnorance/#Examples-and-use-cases","text":"","title":"Examples and use cases"},{"location":"reporters/","text":"Reporters \u00b6 Used to get analysis results.
