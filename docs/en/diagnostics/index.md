# Diagnostics

Used for code analysis to meet coding standards and search for possible errors.

Some of diagnostics are disabled by default. Use [configuration file](../features/ConfigurationFile.md) to enable them.

To escape individual sections of code or files from triggering diagnostics, you can use special comments of the form `// BSLLS:DiagnosticKey-off` . This functionality is described in more detail in [Escaping sections of code](../features/DiagnosticIgnorance.md) .
