# Empty statement (EmptyStatement)

## Description

An empty statement is an operator consisting only of a semicolon (";"). Usually appears when:

- refactoring, when the developer deleted a part of the code, but forgot to delete the last ";"
- "copy paste", when the developer pasted the copied code containing the final character ";"
- inattentive, when the developer twice (or even more) times clicked the symbol ";"

An empty statement does not lead to code errors, but clutters it, reducing perception.
